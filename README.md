# 📧 Email Manager Dashboard

> Track all your forwarded email addresses in one place! ✨

A minimalist dashboard that helps you monitor and track emails from multiple forwarding addresses (like cv@domain.com, contact@domain.com) that redirect to your main personal inbox.

## ⚡ Key Features

- 📥 Monitor emails from multiple forwarding addresses
- 📊 Track which forwarding address received each email
- 🔍 Identify the original recipient address for each email
- 🚀 Built with Astro
- ☁️ Powered by Cloudflare Workers

## 🛠️ How it Works

1. Set up email forwarding (e.g., cv@domain.com → your-personal@email.com)
2. Cloudflare Workers processes incoming emails and tracks the original recipient
3. View all forwarded emails in a clean dashboard, knowing exactly which address received each email

## 📝 Example Use Case

If you have multiple forwarding addresses like:

- cv@domain.com → your-personal@email.com
- contact@domain.com → your-personal@email.com
- newsletter@domain.com → your-personal@email.com

This dashboard will help you identify which address received each email, even though they all end up in the same inbox.
